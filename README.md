# Claude Chef

This repository is a small React built Webapp making use of the Claude API to create recipees based on a bunch of ingredients.

Note: This repository is an exercise from Bob Zirroll's React course on the Scrimba platform: [https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e)
