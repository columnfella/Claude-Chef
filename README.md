# Claude Chef

This repository is a small React-built web app that uses the Claude API to create recipes based on a list of ingredients.

Note: This repository is an exercise from Bob Zirroll's React course on the Scrimba platform: [https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e)
